    "Welcome to this Programming Society workshop! Today, we'll be looking at how we can use `Python` to model real-world phenomena, and produce some awesome looking results. By the end of this, you will hopefully have modelled an epidemic, simulated a the motion of a planet and its moon, and much more! The notebook and supplementary code is intended to be used with `Python`, however if you are far more competent with another language, feel free to follow along with that - just note that you'll have to use your own environment to run it, and you'll need to write some extra code for things such as viewing and graphing.\n",

All the necessary formulae are provided for you. Conversely, if you do enjoy it, you are encouraged to work through and produce the results yourself.\n",
